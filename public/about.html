                    <p>
                        a Sophomore <strong>Game Design Major</strong> at <strong>Bradley University</strong> with a minor in
                        <strong>Computer Science and Information Systems</strong> and
                        <strong>Creative Writing</strong>. Although I’ve been programming since my fingers could reach a keyboard, it wasn’t
                        until games helped
                        me through a difficult time in life that I decided I wanted to dedicate my life to creating them. I believe that
                        games,
                        whether video or tabletop, have the power to have a real impact on people’s lives.

            <p>
                Since I’ve begun working on games, I’ve gained experience working as a Programmer, Producer and Designer using tools
                such as <strong>Unity</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>GitHub</strong>, <strong>Trello</strong>, 
                <strong>Adobe CC</strong>, and <strong>Aseprite</strong> through working on various personal and university
                projects. I have a passion for learning new skills, design patterns, and workflows, and getting to work with my peers at
                Bradley has helped me do just that.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not working on games, I’m often playing or thinking about them. I love picking apart games and the design
                choices and intentions that went into them. Other than games, I love spending my time with friends, sketching, biking,
                and helping where I can with organizations on campus. I also love expanding my artistic horizons both by learning new
                skills (like learning how to make this website!) and experiencing new media.
